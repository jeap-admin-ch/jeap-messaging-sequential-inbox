    shortDescription: >
      A jEAP library that ensures Kafka messages are processed in a predefined sequence,
      regardless of the order in which they are received.
    longDescription: >
      The jEAP Sequential Inbox is a library for microservices that require strict
      ordering of message processing. It consumes messages from Kafka topics and applies
      a sequence configuration, defined via YAML, to determine the exact order in which
      messages with the same contextId should be processed. This allows complex workflows,
      such as order processing, to maintain data consistency and business rules even when
      events arrive out of order. The library supports fine-grained sequencing by message
      type and subtype, release conditions based on predecessor events, and multi-cluster
      Kafka consumption. It requires the microservice to define the sequencing data model
      and integrates seamlessly into jEAP-based messaging services.
    features:
      - Configurable sequencing of Kafka messages by contextId, type, and subtype
      - Supports release conditions to control when dependent messages are processed
