## [10.1.0] - 2025-11-12

### Changed

- Update parent from 5.15.0 to 5.15.1

## [10.0.0] - 2025-11-07
### Changed
- Buffered sequenced messages are no longer immediately deleted when their retain-until date is reached. Instead, they
  are marked for removal and retained for an additional interval (`jeap.messaging.sequential-inbox.housekeeping.delay`).
  This delay allows DevOps engineers time to resolve sequencing issues. After the interval, the inbox housekeeping
  process forwards the messages to the error handling service and then deletes them from the inbox. This version of
  the inbox library is breaking because of a needed new field on the `inbox_sequence_instance` table. See the file
  [./jeap-messaging-sequential-inbox-test/src/test/resources/db/migration/common/V2__add-remove-after-to-sequence.sql]
  for a DDL script that performs the schema upgrade from version 9 to version 10.0.0. In addition, you have to explicitly
  set the new property `jeap.messaging.sequential-inbox.housekeeping.delay` as it has no default value.
